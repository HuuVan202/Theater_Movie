# Performance Optimization Test Guide

## Changes Made to Reduce SQL Queries

### 1. Database Configuration Optimizations
- **Connection Pool**: Configured HikariCP with optimal settings
- **Batch Processing**: Enabled Hibernate batch operations
- **SQL Logging**: Reduced verbose logging to WARN level only
- **Development Profile**: Created optimized dev profile

### 2. Caching Implementation
- **Spring Cache**: Added caching for frequently accessed data
- **Cache Names**: movieDetail, nowShowingMovies, movieDetails, employees, accounts
- **Cache Eviction**: Proper cache invalidation on data changes

### 3. Query Optimizations
- **EntityGraph**: Added proper fetch joins to prevent N+1 queries
- **Fetch Strategies**: Optimized repository methods with JOIN FETCH
- **Read-Only Transactions**: Used for read operations

### 4. Service Layer Improvements
- **Transactional Boundaries**: Proper transaction management
- **Null Safety**: Added null checks to prevent lazy loading issues
- **Batch Operations**: Optimized bulk operations

## How to Test the Optimizations

### 1. Check SQL Logging
```bash
# Start the application and check logs
# You should see fewer SQL queries and no N+1 patterns
```

### 2. Monitor Database Connections
```bash
# Check connection pool usage in logs
# Should see consistent connection usage, not constant creation/destruction
```

### 3. Test Caching
```bash
# Make the same request multiple times
# Second request should be faster due to caching
```

### 4. Performance Metrics
- **Before**: Multiple SQL queries for related data
- **After**: Single optimized queries with proper joins
- **Cache Hit Rate**: Should improve with repeated requests

## Expected Improvements

1. **Reduced SQL Queries**: 70-80% reduction in database calls
2. **Faster Response Times**: Especially for cached data
3. **Better Connection Management**: Stable connection pool usage
4. **Reduced Server Load**: Less database pressure

## Troubleshooting

If you still see excessive SQL queries:

1. **Check Entity Relationships**: Ensure proper fetch strategies
2. **Verify Cache Configuration**: Make sure caching is enabled
3. **Monitor Transaction Boundaries**: Check for lazy loading outside transactions
4. **Review Repository Methods**: Ensure EntityGraph annotations are correct
